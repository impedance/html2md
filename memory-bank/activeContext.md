# Active Context: doc2md

## Current Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the doc2md project to establish proper documentation foundation and context for future development work.

## Recent Changes
- Created complete memory bank structure with all required core files
- Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context
- Established foundation for tracking progress and active development

## Next Steps
- Create progress tracking file to document current status
- Review and validate memory bank content accuracy
- Begin working on any active development tasks using this established context

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Following the memory bank structure as defined in .clinerules
- Using content from CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md to populate core documentation
- Ensuring all core memory bank files are created and properly structured
- Maintaining consistency with existing project documentation and structure

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Pipeline architecture with modular, independent phases
- CLI-first approach with Typer framework
- Configuration-driven design with external files
- Test-driven development with comprehensive unit testing
- SOLID principles and clean code practices

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project follows a well-defined pipeline architecture
- Strong emphasis on documentation and code quality
- Modular design allows for independent development and testing
- Configuration-driven approach enables flexibility and customization
- Comprehensive testing strategy with example-based validation
