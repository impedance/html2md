# Progress: doc2md

## Current Status
âœ… Memory bank initialization completed
âœ… All core documentation files created and populated
âœ… Project context established for future development

## What Works
- âœ… Memory bank structure follows .clinerules specification
- âœ… All required core files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md) created
- âœ… Content accurately reflects project information from CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md
- âœ… Documentation is comprehensive and well-structured
- âœ… Ready for active development work

## What's Left to Build
- ðŸ”„ Review and validate memory bank content accuracy
- ðŸ”„ Begin active development tasks using established context
- ðŸ”„ Update progress tracking as development continues

## Known Issues
- None at this time

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial memory bank structure established based on .clinerules
- Content populated from existing project documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md)
- Foundation set for ongoing documentation and progress tracking
- Ready to support development workflow and decision tracking

## Next Milestones
- Validate memory bank completeness and accuracy
- Begin implementing features per implementation-plan.md and todo.md
- Continue following AGENTS instructions for development workflow
- Maintain memory bank updates as project evolves
